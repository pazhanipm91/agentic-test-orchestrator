## 🧠 Confidence Scoring & Self-Healing

The system assigns a confidence score to each failure analysis generated by the LLM.
Low-confidence failures trigger autonomous test regeneration, while high-confidence
failures are surfaced for human review.

📁 Implementation:
- agents/confidence_scorer.py
- engine/retry_controller.py
