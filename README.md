LLM reasons about API behavior, failures, and improvements

## Supports OpenAI + Local LLMs (Ollama / Llama3 / Mistral) for enterprise environments.
# Swap OpenAI with Ollama endpoint

## 🧠 Confidence Scoring & Self-Healing

The system assigns a confidence score to each failure analysis generated by the LLM.
Low-confidence failures trigger autonomous test regeneration, while high-confidence
failures are surfaced for human review.

📁 Implementation:
- agents/confidence_scorer.py
- engine/retry_controller.py

## 🚀 Agentic API Testing Framework
An autonomous system that moves beyond static test cases to reasoned API reliability.

🧠 The Architecture: Planner–Executor–Evaluator
Unlike traditional automation, this system utilizes a multi-agent loop:

Planner: Analyzes OpenAPI specifications to determine critical paths.

Generator: Produces executable pytest code.

Executor: Runs tests in a deterministic environment.

Analyzer (The "Brain"): If a test fails, the LLM performs a root-cause analysis to distinguish between a "flaky test" and a "real API bug."

🛠️ Key Features
Self-Healing Loop: Automatically suggests test updates when API contracts change.

LLM Failure Reasoning: Detailed classification of errors (e.g., Logic vs. Infrastructure).

Local LLM Support: Fully compatible with Ollama (Llama3/Mistral) for secure, enterprise environments.
